/// This is a unique genetic algorithm strategy, the "inertial" strategy.

/// This is a modification of the [`continuous::ContinuousTrainer`] that implements a further extension of the
/// genetic algorithm. instead of mutations and crossovers, this trainer makes exclusive use of a concept referred
/// to as "mutation vectors". Borrowing from the more well known machine learning technique of gradient descent,
/// mutations are characterized not as random adjustemnts to a given gene, but as mutation vectors, which can
/// represent a given gene's velocity making mutations in a certain direction. in this way, a gene accrues
/// "mutation inertia" over time as it mutates in positive ways, gaining momentum towards mutation directions that
/// improve its fitness.
